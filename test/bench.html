                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
                    2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                    the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                    Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
                    et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
                    BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
                    the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
                    amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
